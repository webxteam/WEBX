# WEBX

The philosophy of the WEBX project is V-POW, the virtual workload proof mechanism.

Prove the correctness and inevitability of the philosophy of V-POW on the EOS blockchain.

Tokens distribution method: Completely reproduce the Bitcoin mining method, using a virtual workload proof mechanism.The total amount of tokens is 10 billion, and the smart contract issues 40 tokens per second to the mining pool. The issuance is halved every 4 years, and each mining gets 1/10,000 tokens. And in the future, the virtual mining pool mode will be opened. The whales could establish a virtual mining pool by staking tokens, attract new miners to enter their own virtual mining pool for mining, and extract handling fees.

Economic model: Bitcoin establishes the currency price by burning electricity, WEBX V-POW enters the repurchase pool by saving the EOS sent by the miners, and the repurchase pool is automatically executed through the algorithm of the smart contract to repurchase tokens on the decentralized exchange to increase the value of tokens.50% of the repurchased tokens will be destroyed, and 50% will enter the DAO account,
